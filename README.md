Data Structures
=====================================

I worked on this project with a pair as a student at Hack Reactor. We implemented the following data structures and inheritance patterns in JavaScript:

## Data structures:

- Queue
- Stack
- Set
- LinkedList
- Tree
- BinarySearchTree
- Graph
- HashTable

## Inheritance Patterns:

- Functional
- Functional-shared
- Prototypal
- Pseudoclassical

### Testing

Tests were written using [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha).
Test are located in the two /spec directories. To run them, open the SpecRunner file in any browser.
